Download Node.js:

Go to the official Node.js website at https://nodejs.org/.
Choose the version you want to install. It's recommended to choose the LTS (Long-Term Support) version for stability, unless you specifically need features from the current version.
Download the installer appropriate for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
Install Node.js:

Once the installer is downloaded, run it.
Follow the installation wizard instructions.
Accept the license agreement if prompted.
Choose the destination folder for installation (the default is usually fine).
Complete the installation process.
Verify Installation:

After installation, open a terminal or command prompt.
Type node -v and press Enter to check the Node.js version. This should display the installed Node.js version.
Type npm -v and press Enter to check the npm version. This should display the installed npm version.
